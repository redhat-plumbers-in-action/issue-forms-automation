# issue-forms-automation

This repository is trying to demonstrate power of newly added [issue form](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-06-23-issues-forms-beta-for-public-repositories/) and automation, to provide better developer experience by labeling issues based on provided input.

This repository is uses [@stefanbuck/github-issue-parser](https://github.com/stefanbuck/github-issue-parser) github action to parse issues generated based on issue forms and is inspired by [@stefanbuck/ristorante](https://github.com/stefanbuck/ristorante).
