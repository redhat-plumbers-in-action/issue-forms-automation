        Do not submit bug reports about anything but the two most recently released *major* systemd versions upstream!
        If there have been multiple stable releases for that major version, please consider updating to a recent one before reporting an issue.
        When using a distro package, please make sure that the version reported is meaningful for upstream.
        See https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable/tags for the list of most recent releases.
        For older version please use distribution trackers (see https://systemd.io/CONTRIBUTING#filing-issues).

        Please use `uname -a` to get linux kernel version.
        Make sure to enclose the pasted kernel version in `backticks`, so that GitHub doesn't convert the `#` character typically included in it into a reference to old GitHub issues.

        Please paste relevant program terminal or journal output here, ideally when generated in debug mode (try setting the `SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable).
        For very long copy/pasted data consider using a service like https://gist.github.com/. Where copy/paste is not possible (for example early boot or late shutdown), a photo of the screen might do too, but text is always much preferred.
